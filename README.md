# FakemarketProject

Fakemarket was developed for an university project. It is an e-commerce website where users are able to browse through 
different products and categories. Those items can be added into their cart and deleted. Then proceed with the payment with Paypal.

To Improve:
  Delete button does not function as it does not get the variables I want to delete. It is likely that I need to modify the way the item is 
  entered onto the Local Storage.
